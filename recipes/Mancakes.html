    <h2>Desciption</h2>
    <p>This mancakes recipe proves that while sweet and savory hybrids can be tricky, sometimes they work beautifully. After all, we are talking about bacon, cheese, and onions, so it wasn't that big of a shock. The way the chipotle-spiced maple syrup brings everything together was a risk well rewarded.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup cornmeal</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Off heat, stir green onions into bacon; sauté in hot drippings until slightly softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer bacon mixture to a strainer; drain. Reserve drippings.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl; whisk in drained bacon mixture, milk, Cheddar cheese, eggs, melted butter, and sugar until batter is smooth. Let batter rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk maple syrup and chipotle chile powder together in a small bowl until chile powder is completely dissolved.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon reserved drippings, 1 teaspoon oil, and 1 teaspoon butter on a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop ¼ cupfuls of batter per mancake onto the griddle; cook until bubbles form and edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip; cook until browned on other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Transfer mancakes to a plate; top with maple syrup. </li>
    </ol>
